# dependencies-useful-scripts
This repo contains dependencies for code in other repos, and some generally useful scripts.
<h2>General-use scripts</h2>
Several MATLAB scripts borrowed, either with modifications (as noted) or in unmodified form, from Dave Glover, Scott Doney, and Bill Jenkins, the instructors of the Modeling, Data Analysis and Numerical Techniques for Geochemistry course (12.747) at MIT. Original versions of scripts are available at http://www.whoi.edu/12.747/mfiles.html (link valid as of 9/9/15).

These include several scripts for linear and non-linear regression:

1. linfit.m, for standard Type 1 linear regression
2. lsqfitma.m, for major axis linear regression  
3. lsqcubic.m, for two-way least-squares linear regression with weighted data (uncertainities in both x and y variables)
4. nlleasqr.m, for non-linear least squares regression of (nearly) any function specified by the user

<h2>Geosciences data I/O</h2>
Several scripts for data input/output and various rudimentary follow-on analyses. Most for stuff in oceanography and the earth sciences (since I'm an oceanographer). These have been moved to https://github.com/jamesrco/GeoSci_IO/
